# Permissions

Block-parkour and multiplayer permission checks are enabled with `permissions.enabled: true` in `plugins/EternalParkour/config.yml`. Elytra permissions are controlled separately by `permissions: true` in `plugins/EternalParkour/elytra/config.yml`. Administrative block-parkour commands always require `ip.admin`; elytra reset and schematic commands require operator status.

When `permissions.enabled` is true, each mode also uses `ip.gamemode.<mode>`, for example `ip.gamemode.speed` or `ip.gamemode.team_survival`.

When `permissions.per-style` is true, styles use `ip.settings.styles.<style>`. Spaces in a style name become dots; for example, `light blue` becomes `ip.settings.styles.light.blue`.

## Elytra

| Permission | Access |
| --- | --- |
| `iep.play` | Play menu |
| `iep.leaderboard` | Leaderboard menu |
| `iep.setting` | Settings menu |

| `iep.setting.style.<style>` | A specific elytra style |
| `iep.leaderboard.<mode>` | A specific mode's leaderboard |
| `iep.setting.<setting>` | A specific setting entry |

Mode and setting names match the keys used by the plugin, such as `min speed`, `time trial`, `radius`, or `metric`.
